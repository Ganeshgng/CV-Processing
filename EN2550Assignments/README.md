*The university has decided to allow “multi-point assessments” instead of written final examinations. I too will adhere to this decision.*

### I have uploaded the following assignments:

1. A01: Basic Operations
2. A02: Fitting
3. A04: Neural networks

### I will upload the following in future:

4. A03: Cameras and multiple-view geometry
5. A05: Segmentation

*We will have several quizzes, out of which I plan the take the best – e.g. , best 3 out of 5 – so that student are not penalized due to not scoring well in a couple of quizzes.*

 
### Marking assessments:

As there is no continuous engagement of students, I am not sure if the learning outcomes are achieved or not. Therefore, I plan to take viva in marking assignments. Therefore, it is very important that you do the assignments on your own.
